## 🧠 Stock Prediction Model (ML Overview)

TrackEx uses a **hybrid machine learning architecture** for predicting stock prices:

- 📌 **Attention-based CNN** – Extracts key temporal features from historical price data  
- 🔁 **BiLSTM & LSTM** – Captures long-term dependencies and sequential behavior  
- 🚀 **XGBoost** – Enhances final prediction accuracy by combining deep learning outputs with boosted trees  

This ensemble approach ensures both **pattern recognition** and **forecast precision** for the stock trends users input.
